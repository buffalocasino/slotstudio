Starting an Open Source IDE for Slot Machine Development Essentially. 
Using Tauri for the exe ability so it will be a windows program to start with looking for any help or direction of the project...
there just isnt an actual easy to use slot machine creator in my opinion and I think its stupid people in the casino industry are banking off secrets and a bunch of greed..
So this tool will be free to use hopefully it becomes 100% functional one day and people end up making some cool things thanks..

Well add some more as the process is going forward thanks..
